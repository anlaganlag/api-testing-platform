# Book Generator Multi-threading Solutions

This document outlines multiple approaches for implementing multi-threaded chapter generation for the Book Writing project.

## Overview of Requirements

- Process a large book with potentially millions of words
- Use multiple free API providers (Deepseek via OpenRouter and Silicon Flow)
- Maintain coherence between chapters
- Ensure fault tolerance and resumability
- Efficiently manage API resources and rate limits

## Solution 1: Enhanced Thread Pool Executor

This approach builds on the existing implementation but optimizes for multiple API providers.

### Key Components
- Create a pool of API clients (OpenRouter, Silicon Flow)
- Implement retry logic with fallback between providers
- Use ThreadPoolExecutor with configurable max_workers
- Cache results to disk to avoid unnecessary API calls

### Advantages
- Simple to implement as extension of current code
- Low overhead for medium-sized books
- Straightforward error handling

### Limitations
- Less efficient for very large numbers of API calls
- Limited control over thread scheduling
- May encounter resource limitations for extremely large books
